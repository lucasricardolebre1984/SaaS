# STATE

Last update: 2026-02-26
Active phase: Implement checkpoint closed (milestone-5-aws-production-bootstrap-slice)
Active feature: milestone-5-aws-production-bootstrap-slice

## Current Decisions
1. Use creation-with-controlled-migration strategy (not direct replacement of fabio2).
2. Keep fabio2 production flow stable while fabio matures.
3. Work in phased specs to avoid scope pollution.
4. Track both engineering and financial metrics from the start.
5. Canonical product model is dual-concierge:
   - Persona 1 = owner orchestrator with full module awareness.
   - Persona 2 = WhatsApp CRM specialist for lead/customer execution.
6. Continuous learning target is mandatory with tiered memory:
   - short session memory
   - medium episodic memory
   - long promoted memory
   with strict tenant/session/channel isolation and auditable trace.
7. SaaS matrix deployment baseline moves to AWS dev:
   - single deploy multi-tenant (`tenant_id` per client),
   - postgres as production persistence backend,
   - Evolution provider server-side (not local desktop dependency),
   - domain bootstrap via `dev.automaniaai.com`.

## Anti-pollution Protocol
- FOCO: continue current phase only.
- ESTACIONAR: store new idea in backlog, no immediate implementation.
- MUDANCA CRITICA: evaluate impact before changing active scope.
- TROCAR FASE: allowed only after phase checklist is complete.

## Open Risks
- Hidden coupling between backend services in fabio2.
- Inconsistent docs vs runtime behavior in legacy areas.
- Scope creep during architecture bootstrap.

## Mitigations
- Brownfield docs maintained as source of truth.
- Task gating with explicit acceptance criteria.
- Weekly architecture review before new migrations.

- Applied operational hotfix `ops-unified-runtime-hotfix`:
  - API runtime now serves unified SaaS on single endpoint `4001` with:
    - Owner console at `/owner/`
    - CRM console at `/crm/`
    - API at `/api/*` (plus direct `/v1/*` compatibility)
  - CORS/preflight standardized for runtime requests (`OPTIONS 204`, allow origin/methods/headers).
  - Owner/CRM consoles now auto-resolve API base for unified mode and migrate legacy local default `http://127.0.0.1:4300` to `window.origin/api` when applicable.
  - local validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
    - `npx nx run app-crm-console:build`
    - smoke check (`/health`, `/api/health`, `/owner/`, `/crm/`, CORS preflight) passed with `200/204`.
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-runtime-config-coupling-slice`:
  - module 06 settings now sync tenant runtime config into backend via:
    - `POST /v1/owner-concierge/runtime-config`
    - `GET /v1/owner-concierge/runtime-config`
  - owner interaction now applies tenant runtime config for:
    - OpenAI provider selection (`openai` when tenant key is configured)
    - persona fallback (tenant prompts when request has no explicit overrides)
    - execution override (`confirm_required` converted to `allow` when tenant disables confirmations)
  - owner console now reports backend sync status instead of local-only note.
  - module 02 (CRM WhatsApp) in Owner Console no longer uses placeholder:
    - embedded CRM view enabled in module workspace
    - owner runtime settings (tenant/api/layout/palette) sync to embedded CRM via URL bootstrap params
  - validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run contract-tests:contract-checks`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
    - `npx nx run app-crm-console:build`
- Applied hotfix `ops-embedded-crm-openai-fallback-hotfix`:
  - CRM embedded mode now hides duplicated internal sidebar/menu when rendered inside Owner module 02.
  - Owner response provider now tries OpenAI `/responses` first and falls back to `/chat/completions`.
  - Tenant runtime OpenAI config now runs in `auto` mode (prefer OpenAI with graceful fallback), reducing hard API failures in chat flow.
  - validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
    - `npx nx run app-crm-console:build`
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-mod-01-openai-strict-provider-slice`:
  - tenant runtime with `openai.api_key` now enforces strict mode (`openai`) in owner interaction path (no silent local fallback).
  - owner interaction failures from provider now surface explicitly as `owner_response_provider_error`.
  - owner console topbar now includes provider telemetry pill:
    - `provider: openai|local|none|error`
    - includes model context when available
  - owner chat trace now logs provider metadata in interaction lines.
  - tenant runtime config store default now uses app storage root when explicit storage path is not provided, preventing global cross-session/test contamination.
  - validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-mod-01-chat-clean-voice-continuous-slice`:
  - new owner endpoint for direct transcription:
    - `POST /v1/owner-concierge/audio/transcribe`
  - owner audio button now runs direct flow:
    - microphone capture -> OpenAI transcription -> auto-send to interaction
  - chat view now omits internal status/task/provider noise in message bubbles (clean operator stream).
  - approvals queue now stays hidden unless there are pending items.
  - continuous mode now activates avatar-first layout with enlarged immersive stage.
  - default OpenAI model baseline adjusted to `gpt-5.1` for owner/runtime config defaults.
  - validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-mod-01-layout-voice-polish-slice`:
  - module 01 layout optimized:
    - reduced right panel width in standard mode
    - composer fixed to bottom with compact side action buttons
    - dead lower white strip removed via flex panel structure
  - continuous mode voice loop now uses browser SpeechRecognition with auto-restart while active.
  - continuous avatar stage reframed to landscape immersive mode to avoid oversized/cropped giant brain behavior.
  - assistant bubble output now normalizes protocol noise (`[accepted]`, `tasks`, `provider`) before render.
  - validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-mod-01-avatar-fullscreen-slice`:
  - approved media `AvatarSaaS.mov` converted and integrated:
    - `avatar-fullscreen.webm`
    - `avatar-fullscreen.mp4`
  - continuous mode UX changed to fullscreen immersive stage:
    - hides sidebar/topbar/chat chrome
    - shows only transparent `Voltar` action
  - runtime source fallback added in owner console (`webm` -> `mp4`) for browser compatibility.
  - validation evidence:
    - `node --check apps/owner-console/src/app.js`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-mod-01-avatar-attachments-hotfix-slice`:
  - fixed black avatar playback by forcing compatibility-first MP4 source and runtime fallback replay hooks.
  - fixed owner attachment path to allow real image/file analysis:
    - owner console now sends inline `data_base64` and bounded `text_excerpt` for supported files
    - runtime now forwards `attachments` to owner response provider
    - OpenAI payload now includes multimodal image input and file context text
  - added regression coverage for attachment forwarding in strict OpenAI mode.
  - validation evidence:
    - `node --check apps/owner-console/src/app.js`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run contract-tests:contract-checks`
- Opened and completed `milestone-4-mod-01-continuous-voice-output-slice`:
  - new tenant-aware endpoint:
    - `POST /v1/owner-concierge/audio/speech`
  - continuous mode now plays assistant responses with OpenAI TTS (female default voice profile) and pauses/restarts recognition around playback.
  - strict tenant checks applied for speech path (`openai_not_configured`, `voice_disabled_by_tenant`).
  - validation evidence:
    - `npx nx run app-platform-api:test`
    - `npx nx run app-owner-console:build`
- Slice `milestone-4-episode-recall-slice` implemented and validated:
  - episode_context from episodeStore.listEpisodes(tenant_id, { session_id, limit: 5 }) in send_message path; payload.episode_context passed to generateAssistantOutput.
  - owner-response-provider injects episode_context into instructions (Responses API) and system message (Chat Completions) when non-empty.
  - validation: `npx nx run app-platform-api:test` (51 tests pass).
- Slice `milestone-4-long-memory-promotion-slice` implemented:
  - after episodeStore.appendEpisode, promote to long memory: resolveMemoryEmbedding + ownerMemoryStore.createEntry (source episode_promotion, external_key); emit memory.promoted.from_episode on success; best-effort (embedding/create failure does not break flow).
  - PROXIMO-PASSO updated: memoria, contexto e aprendizado fechados no produto.

## Next Checkpoint
- Slice `milestone-4-long-memory-promotion-slice` implementado: promocao episodio -> memoria longa (createEntry source episode_promotion, evento memory.promoted.from_episode); PROXIMO-PASSO atualizado: memoria, contexto e aprendizado fechados no produto.
- **Produto:** memoria/contexto/aprendizado fechados (ver `.specs/project/PROXIMO-PASSO.md`). Nenhum passo pendente neste eixo.
- Opened `milestone-5-aws-production-bootstrap-slice`:
  - published spec/design/tasks for AWS dev bootstrap, deploy gate, and runbook
  - added readiness command `npm run deploy:aws:readiness`
  - published env baseline `.env.aws.example`
  - published deploy runbook `apps/platform-api/RUNBOOK-aws-deploy-dev.md`
- Validation evidence for milestone-5 bootstrap:
  - `npm run deploy:aws:readiness -- -SkipDnsResolve` failed only on local Docker unavailability (`smoke-postgres`).
  - `npm run deploy:aws:readiness -- -SkipDnsResolve -SkipSmokePostgres` passed.

## Legacy Quarantine Policy (critical)
- Legacy code in fabio2 is reference for business behavior, not implementation source.
- Direct copy/paste of route, persona, or context orchestration code is forbidden by default.
- Every migrated domain must define contract-first interfaces before implementation.
- Persona and context flow will be redesigned as explicit modules with boundaries and tests.
- If behavior is unclear, preserve business intent and rewrite implementation cleanly.
- contratos directory copied from fabio2 as approved legacy asset import.

## Scope Decisions (new)
- Closed SaaS model approved with modules 1 to 5.
- Module 01 is owner orchestrator with continuous chat + avatar support.
- Module 02 is WhatsApp CRM concierge integrated with Evolution container.
- Module 03, 04, and 05 are mandatory as reusable neutral core modules.
- Persona remains optional/configurable and tenant-specific.

- agent-skills-cli-mvp MVP completed (skills + trigger matrix + runbook + installer test).
